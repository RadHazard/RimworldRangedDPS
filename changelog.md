# v1.0.0 - Initial Release
- Adds a "Ranged Damage Per Second" stat to ranged weapons
- The base stat is the expected DPS if all shots hit.  Clicking it gives a detailed breakdown of expected DPS at various ranges based on the the weapon's accuracy stats


# v1.0.1 - Best Accuracy
**Minor tweaks**
- Updated the DPS stat to use the best-achieveable accuracy of the gun instead of assuming an accuracy of 100%.  Should make it easier to compare weapons with low base accuracy, like miniguns


# v1.1.0 - Turret Support
**Features**
- Added support for turrets as well
- Added back the original DPS ignoring accuracy as a separate stat, "Max Ranged Damage Per Second"

**Bugfixes**
- Added support for minimum ranges to the turrets


# v1.1.1 - Hotfix
**Bugfixes**
- Replaced the bad assembly that was uploaded in v1.1.0 by accident.  Should fix the null pointer exceptions


# v1.1.2 - Hotfix
**Bugfixes**
- Fixed an issue that caused a null pointer exception to be thrown when looking at an abstract ThingDef (e.g. in the Prepare Carefully screen)
- Fixed the turret support to work with mortars and similar ammunition-using turrets.
- Added several sanity checks with verbose error messages to hopefully catch the most common null pointer exceptions

**Known Issues**
- Turrets with swappable ammunition (e.g. mortars) will only show their DPS when loaded with ammunition.  This is a technical limitation due to there being no easy way to get a sane default ammunition.


# v1.2.0 - Rimworld 1.2 support
**Features**
- Updated to Rimworld 1.2
- Added a new "Ranged DPS" stat to pawns and turrets that accounts for their shooting ability in addition to everything else.  Turrets' old "Ranged damage per second" stat has been renamed to "Weapon ranged DPS" just like the equivalent stat on guns.

**Changes**
- "Ranged damage per second" has been renamed "Weapon ranged DPS" to more clearly indicate that it's based only on the stats of the weapon and not the shooter.
- "Max ranged damage per second" has been renamed "Max ranged DPS" to be consistent with the other stat names
